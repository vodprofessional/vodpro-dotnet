# Developing Vodkr's VUIX Library

The VUIX Library site https://library.vodkr.com runs on Umbraco v4.7.2.  This has been customised and enhanced to provide additional functionality to support our subscription library product.

If you are reading this document you have probably been contracted to build an enhancement to our system. This document outlines how to begin doing this. If any of the terminology is unfamiliar to you, then feel free to ask us what we mean, although it may also indicate to you that you aren’t the right person to carry out the work and you should let us know as soon as you can; your honesty will be hugely appreciated :)

## You Will Need
* A GitHub account (obviously)
* A Windows development environment with the .Net 4 framework installed
* Visual Studio - we've built on the 2015 Community edition
* SQL Server 2014

## Getting Access to our codebase
You'll be branching from the *develop* branch of this repo, and we expect that you'll make feature branches for whatever work you're carrying out. To keep the repo clean, we suggest that you use the git excludes list provided at the end of this document.

You'll need to download our sanitised development DB “vodprofessional_umbraco_ext” and restore it into your dev system. It's available here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PjMCbUd9wcrgqwziTilrsWfJI9cku19K/view?usp=sharing

## Local Setup
We'll take it for granted you know how to:
* Restore a SQL database and assign a login;
* Load up a Visual Studio Project and point it to the database;
* Pull whatever nuget packages are missing;
* Change directory paths and permissions for Umbraco to run properly.

Once running, the Umbraco admin user is 
U: vp_admin
P: vp2016

## Sharing your work with us
Once you have something to show us, we hope that you will be able to share your progress with us via your own hosted environment. If this is not the case, please let us know and we will explore other options, but we imagine that this may severely slow down the development lifecycle.

Once we have signed off your work we'll need to discuss how we get those changes into UAT. This is likely to involve a mixture of:
1. Your changes committed to the Github repo;
2. SQL scripts of any DB changes;
3. If you are producing pure Umbraco changes, e.g. Document types, data types and so on, then creating an Umbraco installation package is a good solution for sharing your changes.  We can work this out on a project-by-project basis.

## Coding style and standards
We expect you to put comments into your code. You don’t need to comment every line, but a short description about what a class or method is for is expected.  Please put a standard comment at the top of all your files with your name and the date in, so we can look back and understand who to call if something goes wrong in future. You can indent with spaces or tabs. Use sensible variable names in English please!

It may be appropriate to keep your work entirely in its own project. Of course this would be simplest for us to integrate and install.

The site has grown organically over several years, so if you want to use existing classes and methods and can’t work out what they do, please contact us directly technical@vodkr.com. 

## Finally
Have fun!
