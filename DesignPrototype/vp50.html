                                <p>Take a look at the Scandinavian online television industry and you'll see plenty of good things: beautiful user interfaces from Magine, robust internet technologies from Ericsson, innovative TV Everywhere solutions from Xstream and new VOD services from, for example, Com Hem and Ostmodern who together recently launched Cirkus.</p>
                                <p>These products are being delivered to an increasingly engaged audience. Consider that in Denmark, Netflix already has over 400,000 subscribers; YouSee from the TDC Group has more than 300,000 frequent users; SVT Play welcomes four million unique viewers a week - of which 40% access the service through mobile devices - and VGTV's online video series, Fanthomas, recorded over 18 million views on the platform.</p>

Now he presides over two worlds, not one: 21st Century Fox, including a 39.1% stake in the European incarnation of Sky; and News Corp, including News UK. Murdoch’s empire would have been bigger still, but he failed to pull off the biggest coup of his career, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/aug/05/rupert-murdoch-withdraws-80bn-bid-time-warner-takeover">an $80bn (£51bn) bid for Time Warner</a>. Now 84, he does not want for ambition. Worth about $14bn, he has reportedly told senior executives he wants to lead the business for another decade.</p>
