                                <p>In 1983 I was given my first Sony Walkman for Christmas,
                                    <em>the</em> revolutionary portable consumer device of its time. We
                                    carried them like weapons in the pockets of our baseball jackets
                                    and guarded them with our lives. That same Christmas saw the
                                    release of the first Now That's What I Call Music compilation and I
                                    don't think I spoke again for about three months (although Sarah
                                    Steel from two streets down tried to speak to me when she saw my
                                    headphones and she wouldn't even look at me before). I was <em>the
                                        man</em>. People went nuts for Walkmans and, just like today, every
                                    upgrade was met with anticipation and excitement. Remember
                                    anti-jog? How about Splash-proof?</p>

                                <h4><strong>The IPTV/VOD Market is Booming</strong></h4>

                                <p>Let's fast forward 30 years and I hope it's not too late to wish
                                    you all a Happy 2014! We know, because the market has reported,
                                    that Father Christmas delivered to many of you, young and not so
                                    young, a huge number of internet enabled devices (smartphones,
                                    tablets, PCs, games consoles, set-top boxes, Smart TVs etc.). Both
                                    Deloitte and the global information company IHS have reported on
                                    the extraordinary growth of consumer demand for these appliances.
                                    Indeed, Deloitte has suggested that as much as <strong><a href="http://www.deloitte.com/view/en_GB/uk/news/news-releases/d83c361a76b83410VgnVCM2000003356f70aRCRD.htm">
                                        50% of the UK consumer market now own a tablet</a></strong> such as
                                    Apple's iPad, Amazon's Kindle Fire or Samsung's Galaxy. It
                                    necessarily follows, therefore, that the early part of the year
                                    will see a huge upsurge in the demand for digital content.
                                    <strong><a href="http://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/audio-video-on-demand-avod-market-1046.html?gclid=CIqW7aCag7wCFSKWtAoddDEA4w">
                                        MarketsandMarkets states that the North American VOD market was
                                        worth over $21bn in 2013</a>.</strong></p>

                                <h4><strong>Everyone's Winning, Right?</strong></h4>

                                <p>For the broad range of technology companies who serve the IPTV
                                    market, this is great news, right? Well, possibly not. The gold
                                    rush is producing some surprising casualties. Recently there was
                                    news that the OTT video offering <strong><a href="http://www.vdio.com/news/">Vdio</a></strong> was shutting
                                    down as it was "…not able to deliver the differentiated customer
                                    experience we had hoped for".</p>

                                <p>Now, Vdio wasn't a start-up with an ill-thought out business
                                    plan and a couple of angel investors demanding a quick return. It
                                    was set up by Skype co-founder Janus Friis, hired Amazon's ex-head
                                    of global video Anthony Bay to run it and had in place content
                                    distribution agreements with all of the majors, including Disney,
                                    MGM, Paramount Pictures, Sony, Warner Bros, NBC Universal, Viacom,
                                    20<sup>th</sup> Century Fox, Dreamworks&nbsp; and others. It
                                    offered access to some incredible content.</p>

                                <p>Vdio also came from Rdio, its audio equivalent service that was
                                    launched in 2010 and is highly regarded. &nbsp;Though subscriber
                                    numbers are elusive, Rdio provides access to over 20 million songs
                                    and provides services in 36 countries and they are thought to be
                                    challenging Spotify for market dominance. In other words, they're
                                    big, successful and, in relative terms, experienced.</p>

                                <p>Vdio offered every Rdio premium subscriber a $25 dollar credit
                                    on their pay-per-view service, which should have given it a
                                    tremendous kick-start. So why did it fail? And why have big
                                    industry names such as Amazon (which had planned to release a
                                    set-top box to enable users direct access to a VOD store) and Intel
                                    Media (which has been on the verge of releasing its set-top box and
                                    service 'OnCue' for the last two years and whom Verizon has just
                                    announced they are buying) begun to distance themselves from the
                                    consumer-facing TV market? The answer to both of those questions
                                    may lie in the simple 'supply and demand' business equation.</p>

                                <h4><strong>Supply and Demand</strong></h4>

                                <p>In a market place, if the ongoing and efficient supply of a
                                    product (<em>content</em>, in this case) increases, the price drops
                                    if there are a number of entities competing for market share. If we
                                    add to that scenario the fact that the content owners selling
                                    certain 'high-profile' content are able to charge something of a
                                    premium you can quickly see how non-content owners in a crowded
                                    market place might struggle, if there are a lot of places
                                    (platforms) for people to buy content.</p>

                                <h4><strong>A Vibrant IPTV/VOD Marketplace</strong></h4>

                                <p>Let's consider in basic terms what it is that creates a vibrant
                                    VOD market.</p>

                                <p class="indent"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Create content that
                                    people want;</p>

                                <p class="indent"><strong>Step 2:</strong> Create a route for that
                                    content to be consumed on any of the increasing myriad of devices
                                    out there. Not that long ago, as Apple's iTunes software, and the
                                    iTunes store, began to grow, many content owners chose to ignore,
                                    or attempted to sidestep them. This was a big mistake and was, in
                                    hindsight, incredibly naïve;</p>

                                <p class="indent"><strong>Step 3</strong>: Ensure that the route
                                    that the content takes (to the device) and the device itself make
                                    the consumer feel good. Is the experience reliable? Is the
                                    interface easy and fun to use? Does the interface encourage the
                                    consumer to view or listen to more by getting those first two
                                    points right as well as through recommendations?</p>

                                <h4><strong>A Sweet Analogy</strong></h4>

                                <p>Imagine a high street, which is lined with sweet shops. Many of
                                    these sweet shops sell the same products (because they're the most
                                    popular). Most of the shops don't actually play a part in producing
                                    the sweets, they just sell them on to their customers. These are
                                    the shops caught in a price war because there are a finite number
                                    of customers. This forces the shops to come up with more and more
                                    inventive ways to attract the customers;</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Have a great shop front to draw the customers in</li>

                                    <li>Make the shopping experience a delight</li>

                                    <li>Create offers (buy a Curlywurly, get a Crunchie for half
                                        price)</li>

                                    <li>Issue loyalty cards</li>

                                    <li>Have promotion days etc.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>But the shops that are owned or part-owned by the producers of
                                    the sweets will make more money because when customers buy their
                                    sweets, a greater proportion of the money spent will go to them and
                                    not to a third party.</p>

                                <p>Let's say one of these sweet shops - we'll call it
                                    <em>NetSweets</em> - is good at all of the above. It provides a
                                    great shopping experience, is well stocked with a broad variety of
                                    popular confectionery, is always open, has built up a loyal
                                    customer base <em>and</em> has started to produce its own sweets.
                                    It's a sweet shop that could do very well in this scenario, right?
                                    So what do the others do? Follow suit? Maybe.</p>

                                <p>Actually, a number of outcomes could follow in order to
                                    challenge <em>NetSweets</em> including buy-outs, joint ventures and
                                    consolidations. Would you open a new sweet shop here? You'd have to
                                    be brave and have a very compelling proposition. By the way, if you
                                    haven't already guessed, the VOD equivalent of <em>NetSweets</em>
                                    is Netflix and you could argue that Vdio is one of the shops that
                                    just battled in trying to attract customers along with all of the
                                    other competitors on the high street (some great, some good, some
                                    indifferent); and that's why they folded.&nbsp;</p>

                                <h4><strong>Consumers Are Getting What They Want (for
                                    now)</strong></h4>

                                <p>Back to the VOD market. If these big hitters are launching
                                    platforms and then failing or stepping back, we could conclude that
                                    the marketplace has enough ways to get to the content that it
                                    wants.</p>

                                <p>If there are enough routes to market for the content to take and
                                    the consumers are satisfied with the price they're paying for it
                                    (and the margins being made by the providers of the content are
                                    acceptable and/or enough to enable growth - not always the case, by
                                    the way), what is the likelihood of success for new entrants?
                                    &nbsp;</p>

                                <h4><strong>Technology Doesn't Stand Still</strong></h4>

                                <p>I hasten to add that technological developments don't reach a
                                    point and then stop (in any industry, not least the media and
                                    broadcast world) and that there could well be more game-changing
                                    platforms or devices around the corner. Whilst the growth of the
                                    IPTV/VOD market is undeniable, the majority of content isn't
                                    currently consumed by people using Smart TVs, tablets, games
                                    consoles or smartphones, but via their 'traditional' (sometimes not
                                    even HD) TVs (i.e. linear channels). &nbsp;Just as, 30 years on
                                    from the launch of the Sony Walkman it's impossible to find someone
                                    who still owns one, in a further 30 years' time the only thing
                                    that's certain is that the market will look completely different
                                    again.&nbsp; But focusing on the short to medium term, the trend
                                    that is most likely to emerge in 2014/15 is a raft of significant
                                    mergers and acquisitions because that is what often happens when
                                    relatively young markets begin to mature. One thing is for certain,
                                    it will be another fascinating and exciting year in this incredible
                                    industry that we are lucky to be a part of. Enjoy it!</p>
